# customer-churn-analysis
                    Here , in this problem two different data sets are given â€“ one for the train purpose and another  one for the test purpose. Train set has 3333 records and 21 features and the test set has 1667 records and 21 features. The main objective of the project is to predict that a customer is churned or not using the information. Here using the train data set we have to make a model which is fit the parameters of the classifier and then test the validation of the model using the test data set. If the model is tested with the test data set then we can conclude that the model is now appropriate to find that a customer is churned or not automatically using necessary information about the customer.
